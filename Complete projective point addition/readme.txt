%-- Project Name: Point Addition in Eliptic curve cryptography
%-- Module Name: projective point addition.
%-- Description: This is a matlab implementation of the Compleate projective point addition for prime order a=0
% short Weistrass curve y^2 = x^3 + b. The equations are proposed in this
% work "Complete addition formulas for prime order elliptic curves"  https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1060.pdf
